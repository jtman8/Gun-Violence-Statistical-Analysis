# Gun Violence Statistical Analysis
This project was completed in two parts for a Statistics course I completed at the University of Virginia. The first part contains Exploratory Analysis while Part 3 contains a succinct report that addresses an issue that has increasingly contributed to the daily news cycle in the United States: gun violence. With the emotionally charged nature of these incidents and the number of policies that could address this issue, it is important that the policies advocated for, and hopefully implemented, are effective in reducing gun deaths. This analysis will center on the effect of raising the age restriction on buying long guns, which consist primarily of rifles and shotguns, to twenty-one years old, instead of eighteen. This policy suggestion seemed to gain increased media attention in February 2018 when Republican President Donald Trump discussed the need to institute this policy, noting that the sale of handguns is currently restricted until the buyer is twenty-one years old under Federal law. Ultimately, this report addresses the question of whether or not this particular policy, of raising the age restriction for long gun purchases, is truly effective at reducing gun deaths.
